# Design

Using typefaces [Rubik](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik "Rubik on Google Fonts"), [Merriweather](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather "Merriweather on Google Fonts"), [Merriweather Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather+Sans "Merriweather Sans on Google Fonts"), and [Overpass Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Overpass+Mono "Overpass Mono on Google Fonts").

# Hosting

*{{ site.title }}* is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and is coded with [Atom](https://atom.io). This blog is hosted on GitHub with Jekyll because...
- GitHub Pages hosts static sites for free :)
- Jekyll offers control over the design of the blog
- GitHub is a great place
- The blog, the posts, and the pages are versioned thanks to [Git](https://git-scm.com/ "Git")
- The ownership of the code base remains within possession with Git and GitHub
- Content is stored in human-readable static text files with Jekyll and, as such, content remains easily accessible --- not locked in arbitrary unreadable binary files.
