Meet the publication for openly sharing our design behind the build of a new e-commerce webapp in Antigua, in a brave, vulnerable practice of [designing in the open](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/designing-in-the-open/ "Designing in the Open, by Brad Frost"), for what feels more like an irresponsible, naive experiment.

"I'm designing the e-commerce webapp in the public." <br/>
"Wait! What? Are you crazy?" <br/>
"Well, a little."

But at heart, we believe in sharing knowledge. If we don't, someone else will eventually anyway. And really it's not big deal. Our app isn't going to be built on some super secret sauce -- well at least not yet. I'm a part of the open source community and my learning has come from other programmers who are willing to share what they know openly and freely for people like myself to learn. The majority of this project will be built on open source technology. My learning has come from free asking questions on forums, from reading free articles and blogs. I see it fit to share what I know.

# Who is it for?
- For ourselves
- For anyone interested in seeing how we building Geemo. I'll be honest, I'm a nobody in a world of professionals whose trying to put out ambitious content far beyond my experience as a developer but its a way to grow.

- I share things like sketches, mockups, prototypes, my techniques, lessons learned, my design decisions, and my ever-evolving process.

- I already feel embarrassed about sharing my undeveloped work and the unseen gaping holes in what I know about making web applications. But, alas, we can’t learn until we’ve made mistakes, and are happy to admit and learn from them. By sharing, I’m learning to accept mistakes.

- Why share your design in the open? I share to 1) get feedback about design decisions, 2) gain interest and build up an audience, and 3) help and inspire others by sharing what I know.
